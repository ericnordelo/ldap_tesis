\begin{english-abstract}
    In this project a computer solution to the problem of access to Human Resources information presented by the University of Havana is developed. The entity currently has an unstable and unsustainable system due to various factors (Directorio Único), among which are the loss of source codes and the disorganized decentralization of the services that comprise it. The objective is to replace this system with a more robust, stable and efficient one that is easily modifiable and sustainable. It is proposed a system based on the LDAP protocol and an interface that allows communication with it in an easy way, as well as the unification of the services currently dispersed into one (or as little as possible). For this, the proposal consists of an LDAP server, an API and a web interface. As the culmination of the work, the adoption of this system at the University of Havana is expected.

    \textbf{Keywords}: Directorio Único, LDAP, API, web interface.
